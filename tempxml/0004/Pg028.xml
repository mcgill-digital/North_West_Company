<p style="text-align:justify;">claim to H. M.'s approbation of his conduct in the Gov<sup>t</sup>; and with an intimation that when Lord Amherst's special Mission is ended, his services in the Province will no longer be required<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  So that Lord Aylmer will remain in the Military command &amp; resume the Government, if he pleases, on Lord Amherst's departure<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Lord Amherst will meet the Legislature, and inquire into the various grievances which the Assembly, and the Conventions and Constitutional associations have to bring forward; &#8212; And I believe he expects to get away in a few months<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  If, as is probable, the Kings entire approbation of Lord Aylmer's conduct is made known at the opening of the extra Session, &#8212; it will not only mortify the Radicals who have been impeaching him, but perhaps <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="Gap">[&#8230;]</span></span> make them resolve not to negotiate with the Commissioner<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Lord Amherst was to sail about the third week in April; but as the dispatches that have been received were written before the overthrow of the Tory Ministry, perhaps that event may make some change; though I do not think it will, for the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">measure</span> of appointing a Comm.<sup>r</sup> was not objected to by any party, &#8212; and Lord Amherst's Commission and instructions were given to him before the change; &#8212; and he is so far from being an adherent of the late Ministry, that he resigned his situation in the Royal Houshold not long after they came into office, in order that he might be free to vote against them if he thought right to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As one of the Commissioners duties will be to ascertain in what manner the Institutions of the country may be improved, for the ends of good government, the ruling party in the House, if they go to business at all, will urge upon him the necessity of an elective Council, &#8212; perhaps of carrying the elective principle into all the other branches of Government; and on this account it is the more important that all the members of Council who value the constitution as it is, should be in their places to defend it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are to have a grand reform meeting here on the 8<sup>h</sup> of June,</p>
