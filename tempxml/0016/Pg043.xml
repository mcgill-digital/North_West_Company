<p style="text-align:justify;">Saturday 25<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Jolie, S<sup>t</sup> André, Lattinville and Laviolette went to Live at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mamaoui</span> &#8211; they had a net between them<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Packs were pressed and the Canoes almost finished<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave 3¾ flaggons of rum to the Men<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It used to be the Custom here to give the Men a Dram after delivering their Cord wood and on their arrival from their fisheries and I read in Journals of other Posts of giving Drams to the Men for every triffling Job<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  But I follow M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Leods Method of giving it all in a Lump which I think pleases more than giving it to them by drops and Drams<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I must however observe that the Custom of giving Drams to Men on arrival with Letters, from the Indians &amp;c. is still followed for People who bring us news from all Quarters deserve more attention than fellows who arrive with their Bellies full of fish to tell us a parcel of Lies and on no other Account than to tease us for hooks nets &amp; Lines<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Tuesday 28<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Having given Courtois several broad Hints of his Motives in promising to set a Net Several times without performing it he got ashamed and set one under the Ice this Morning in which he took 22 P<sup>s</sup> this evening<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The weather excessive Cold<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
