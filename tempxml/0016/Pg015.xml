<p style="text-align:justify;">wood and that of Loyez<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The six Montagners who arrived yesterday went off this Morning<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  N.B. The Dog which Cadien &amp; Bouché ate on their last Trip to starve belongs to the Company &amp; was bought of Picote for the Size of a Cote de Boeuf of an old Lodge.  Bouché however had a Dog of his own along with him as eatable as that of the Company<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Fine weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A shower of Rain fell this Morning<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sunday 5<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mandeville delivered Lafleur's Cord wood<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Cadien returned 6½ Measures of the Amm: he had to go in Land &#8211; Bouché returned 6 Ditto<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave them 15 Hooks with Lines an old Cod Line, an old Net &amp; one New Net which they are to take from F. LaBri, I mean only the New Net from L<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Monday 6<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This Morning Hache who arrived here with Cadien after accompanying him on his starving excursion went away so as to trench towards Lac Des Brochets<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span> Masquawsis being weary of the sedentary Life of a Cook went with Hache this morning to accustom himself to that of a Montagner and also to pay a few Credits he owes<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave him a single Carriboux robe &amp; 10 whitefish<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I would have asked him to stay in order to interpret were I not afraid that it would spoil him more, by making him think himself of more consequence than he really is, than it would do good to the Company to Keep him as I don't expect many Montagners till his return<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Fine weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The snow melted of the Houses<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The snow melted of the houses the same as yesterday<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednesday 8<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mandeville and Lattinville arrived from the old Fort.  The former brought 100 whitefish to Cadien le Blanc &amp; returned 20 Ditto he had borrowed here when cutting his cord wood<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He gave Cadien the largest &amp; the smallest to me &#8211; of this piece of Canadien Hoggishness I did not fail to speak to him not for the value of the difference in size in 20 whitefish but merely to let him see that I was not so blind to perceive his Hoggish Tricks as he as well as all frenchmen are apt to eat the best themselves instead of offering it to a person in my place of whose services they are every moment in need &amp; whose patience they often tire at the expense of their Employers without a thank to either<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  These Men inform us that there is a Band of Montagners encamped on Bustard Island but had not the curiosity to go &amp; see who they were and where <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bound</span> to<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The truth is they did not smell that these Montagners had any Meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Lambert fired &amp; missed upon a wolf<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 9<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mandeville, Lattinville, Cadien &amp; Bouché went off<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The first two for the old Fort &amp; the two latter to fish at L'Isle Brulé<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Lambert Deliver&#8217;d Joseph Neau's Wood<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mandeville asked to go with M<sup>r</sup> Wentzel to the Forks<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 10<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Lambert missed 2 shots upon a partridge which he attributes to the badness of his Fusil &#8211; but we fired it on a mark and found it good<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Fine Day<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
