<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 9<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Saurarda arrived &amp; paid 72 Skins Beaver Credits between himself and 2 Sons<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This Indian brought his Daughter who deserted in the Course of the winter from Morin at Slave Lake in order to be returned <span class="AddHand-author">to</span> her husband (Morin)<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  M<sup>r</sup> Porter wrote me per Morins orders to sell her to the Highest bidder &amp; debit Morin for the Amount<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Two advantages may be reaped from this <span class="AddHand-author">affair</span> &#8211; the first is, that it will assist to discharge the Debts of a Man unable to do it by any other Means for he is neither good Middleman, foreman, Steersman, Interpreter, or Carpenter &#8211; the next is, that it may be the mean of tickling some lecherous Miser to part with Some of his Hoard<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I therefore Kept the woman to be disposed of in the Season when the Peace River <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bucks</span> begin to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">rut</span> most, I mean in the Month of May<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Traded this day several <span class="AddHand-author">P</span><span class="AddHand-author"><sup>rs</sup></span>of old Rackettes from the Indians<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It will not be amiss to tell in this Journal that our lately created Chief Marlin, has undertaken not only the reformation of the Chepewean Grievances at his own post but also that of Grievances of Chepeweans at other Posts.  The present Complaint is that the Montagners of Slave Lake are too numerous for the quantity of Goods Sent there every fall<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Then Marlin's Question was whether it would not be better to bring all the Montagners to winter between this Post and Grand Marrais &#8211; &amp; to leave the Slave Lake for the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Red Knives</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  My answer was that too many Goods were sent every fall to Slave Lake because the most of the Montagners there are Damned Rascals who run off w<sup>t</sup> their Credits to their Lands and that as for bringing such fellows here <span class="AddHand-author">it</span> would be mere nonsense for these who are here already never pay their Credits owing, as they alledge, to the scarcity of Beaver &#8211; and how much more scarce it would become would so many more Carcajoux be let loose among it<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
