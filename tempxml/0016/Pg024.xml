<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3Pouces</span> told me he intended to go this Summer to make war upon the Eskimeaux &#8211; this I look upon as a sham to get goods for nothing &#8211; however in case it might be otherwise I thought fit to dissuad him from it<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Petit Lievre</span> who paid the most of his Credits the value of 4 Skins gratis with a view to encourage him to behave well another time and also in order to vex those who did not pay the third of their C<sup>rs</sup> whom I reproached and laughed at for their laziness while I rewarded &amp; praised the other for his industry<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Traded this day 26 skins in fresh Meat, 2 d<sup>o</sup> Grease, 2½ d<sup>o</sup> Pack Cords, &amp; 3½ Beaver Stones<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Snowed in the Evening<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  All the Indians except Hachie went off.  They promised to come again in the Month of April if they can catch any Skins &#8211; if not they will not come till next fall<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave 3Pouces the value of 16 skins &#8211; not in consideration of his past behavior which deserved no reward but on Condition of his behaving <span class="DelHand-author">well</span> here this Summer in every respect becoming a broken Chief who wishes to be restored to his former <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dignities</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It would have been an easy matter to send these Indians away all pleased by flatly refusing them all they wanted but it would not be an easy Matter to bring them back again &amp; to keep them from Speaking unfavourably of the Fort so as to prevent other Indians from approaching it<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The more that can be prevailed on to Stay here about in the Summer for Next winter the greater the returns of next year will be &#8211; and the more they will be pleased the more they will be attached to us in case of Intruder's who may Change the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">face</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">affairs</span> so far as to oblige us to please the Montagners when it will be more difficult than it is now<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  To please them everybody who has wintered along with them Knows that not only fair words but Some goods are necessary to do it effectually &amp; if it is <span class="AddHand-author">not done</span> well what is the good of doing it at all<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I should not therefore think it in the least a waste of Goods to give every Montagner who promises faithfully this spring not to Stir from the fort all summer, 2 Measures Ammunition, 1 foot bad tob<sup>c</sup>, 1 awl 1 firesteel, 1 flint, &amp; 1 Gun worm gratis<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Supposing in this manner two pieces were spent would it not be infinitely repaid by a great increase in Packs next year or perhaps by preventing an opposition if such takes place from making any returns and thereby banishing them the place<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This method has been tried there when I think from many concurring reasons it was not so necessary as now<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It is true my Accompt Current will suffer by it &amp; a Bourgeois sitting in his arm<span class="DelHand-author">ed</span> Chair at the Grand Portage will not scruple to call me an extravagant fellow at sight of the immense amount without enquiring about the manner it was incurred &#8211; but should he not take this trouble he is Bourgeois &amp; consequently has the power to supersede me by sending another who will act better in my place<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Cadien le Blanc &amp; his two wives arrived with fish<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He means to go with Hachie tomorrow to fetch for himself the thighs shoulders &amp; croops of 4 Animals which this Indian <span class="AddHand-author">has</span> in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cache</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Near Dark an Indian arrived from the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Poile</span> &#8211; he saw no Indians in his voyage &amp; he has only 30 Skins &#8211; by this young Man he sent 2 fathoms of tob<sup>c</sup> which he had last fall to be given to Indians<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Nothing Particular happened besides all this<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
