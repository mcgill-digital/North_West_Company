<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 27<sup>th</sup> March 1800<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  About 12 oClock a young Man arrived from Marlin with a small Keg of his own making to be filled with rum<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Marlins band Consists of 14 Men including himself<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Paspartous who is a long with them Counted all their Skins and according to his Computation they have 19 packs<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Ch<sup>s</sup> Cadiens Comrade arrived and paid 25 Skins Credits which make him 85 Skins this winter<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[F]</span>ine weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>

Is it because 7 parts in 8 of this rum are pure water, of course <span class="DelHand-author">is</span> less expensive to the C<sup>o</sup> and pleases the Indians more than other Goods?  No Gentlemen I suppose you will say it is because it Debauches the Indians and renders them troublesome but can sending a small keg in land by a Clerk debauch them more than giving them a Large keg in the fall and spring by a Bourgeois at the Fort while the Clerk who succeeds him is limited to <span class="AddHand-author">give</span> a smaller present in a kettle<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  If the Indians be spoiled it is the Bourgeois not the Clerks that do it &#8211; the former give the Indians every time they pass large presents which the latter are either afraid or forbid to give &#8211; the one of Consequence are regard'd by the Indians as superiour Beings whom they must adore &#8211; the other as mere tools to them whom they may despise and need not mind<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Notwithstanding all this our Employers expect the same returns from us as they could hope from one of themselves in our places &#8211; but they cannot conceive that in our little stations we must act on as high a scale in order to produce the same effect as they<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Here again Gentlemen of the Cynick Cast you will reprimand my warmth which in your phrase is empertinence to presume to speak against my Employers &#8211; but be pleased to recollect that though I have spoken against</p>
