<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 21<sup>st</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A little before sun set Trois Pouces &amp; his Slave and another Slavish<span class="DelHand-author">ish</span> looking fellow arrive with each a Train but with little or nothing on them &#8211; previous to his arrival he thought proper to send a Messenger to announce his being near hand &amp; to ask tob<sup>c</sup> &#8211; of this rotten stuff for there is none good here, I sent him 1 foot<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I quarrelled him &amp; reasoned him out of the little sense he has got bec<span class="AddHand-author">a</span>use after twelve Months absence he brought neither Skins nor Indians but I believe as he is a rooted rascal that reasoning or scolding will have little effect upon his future any more than they had upon his former Conduct &#8211; however I could not help trying &#8211; &amp; if I fail nothing can be lost by it but words<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  At the same time with this fellow two of the Indians who had Credits here last fall arrived &#8211; one of them, called the Petit Lievre from I.L.C., paid 44 Sks out of 56 &#8211; the other from Slave Lake &amp; brother to Six Fingers after 5 months absence paid only 29 out of 81, which through M<sup>r</sup> Porter's recommendations of him I was induced to entrust him last fall<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Near Dark Cantaras arrived from Pointe des Roches with a train of dried trouts for himself &amp; two very large &amp; two very small but all very good trout as a present for us<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A while after Dark Masquawsis &amp; Hachi who left this, in the last month arrived with several Trains of fresh Meat, the only thing they looked for since their Departure<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It was impossible for me to avoid shewing the latter my Just displeasure at his behavior &#8211; but he excused himself by assuring me that he will kill his Credits yet before the embarkation<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saturday 22<sup>nd</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Cantaras went away<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave him half of a Plat Coté of old Bull &amp; two hooks for his trouts &#8211; the hooks he asked &#8211; desired him to tell the others to bring no more presents of this Kind since they must be returned in this Manner<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Received this day from 3Pouces, d<sup>o's</sup> By<sup>r</sup>, Liduazé, and Peresise 21½ Skins of their Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Now it must be owned these are clever fellows and afford a fine prospect of what is to be expected this year from the Carribou Country &#8211; between 4 Blockheads in a years time they could not complete 22 Skins but must needs leave them ½ Skin less and arrive here two months before the time they should and the very best season for working Beaver<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Montagners degenerate every year &#8211; last year they worked worse than the preceding one &amp; this year it is is visible already that they will work less than last year<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It will soon be beyond the power of any Man <span class="DelHand-author">to</span> either to reason or compel them into any good<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I have been haranguing them all this day not to return any more to their Lands, to try &amp; pay their Credits this spring &amp;c.  They promised Compliance and accordingly had a few more Credits &#8211; but I doubt that they will Keep to their word<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  3Pouces</p>
