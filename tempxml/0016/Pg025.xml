<p style="text-align:justify;">Monday 24<sup>th</sup> Feb<sup>y</sup> 1800.  This Morning Cadien le Blanc &amp; Hachie with their families went away<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The latter paid 19 Skins of his Credits and means to trench hard for the rest<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave him two Measures of Ammunition &amp; a bit of Tob<sup>c</sup> upon his promising to arrive <span class="AddHand-editors">[o]</span>n the last Ice with more than his Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Soon after the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Poiles</span> young man went away<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Sent a piece of tob<sup>c</sup> to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">poile</span> with word that I would not be displeased with him if he brought all his Credits and more if he can<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave this Indian 1 M. Am. and a P<sup>s</sup> of bad Tob<sup>c</sup>, I mean the length of my finger<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It is not amiss to remark here that Lambert having asked permission to go with Hachie to make pounded Meat for his wife in the Summer was told he might go <span style="text-decoration:underline;">en</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">tous</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sureté</span> &#8211; but he did not go as his wife thought his Child too weak to endure the Cold and as he did not like to leave me alone w<sup>t</sup> Masquawsis<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I suppose he wanted to be begged to stay bu<span class="AddHand-editors">[t]</span> finding his mistake he was content to remain where he was told to go instead of being told to Stay &#8211; for fear to be turned off for good &amp; all like Dusablon last fall<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  In the Evening Genereux arrived from the Islands squiring Madame Courtois along on one leg<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tuesday 25<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Biguilliazé arrived<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Masquawsis all day busy making Traps at Mamaoui<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Traded with Biguilliazé 1 skin worth of fresh Meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He went after hachie &amp; so did Masquawsis because there is no fat Meat here<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Told him that as he is such Cochon as to think of nothing else but his belly he might go where he pleased &#8211; which is a greater privilege than the generality of Cochons possess<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Soon after these fellows' departure arrived Lebeau and &amp; one of Nose's Sons they left their band Consisting <span class="AddHand-author">of</span> 7 Men and the E. Chiefs By<sup>r</sup> at their head in River d&#8217;écorse about 2 days march from here<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They are doing nothing and have not half their Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Marlin left them last fall since which time they have had no acc<sup>t</sup> of him or any of his followers<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave Lebeau 1 foot Tobacco &amp; 1 small bit <span class="AddHand-author">to </span>the Indian<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 27<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Early this morning Le Beau and the Indian went off<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Sent the E. Chiefs By<sup>r</sup> who fancies himself of greater Note than the rest, one foot Tobacco &#8211; &amp; a small bit to each of those who are along with him with a great many Menaces of ill treatment if they do not try &amp; pay the Most of their Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave this young man who has 60 Skins of his Credits 2 M<sup>s</sup> of Ammunition and a small P<sup>s</sup> Tobacco &amp; desired him to tell the other young men they would be rewarded in the same manner if they behaved so well<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He was well pleased &amp; promised more than he has either the will or Capacity to perform<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 28<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  About 10 o'Clock Naudarrai &amp; Toutouche arrived<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They wintered where there is a great deal of Beaver but did not work through fear of the Crees<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Toutouche had 70 Skins on Credit since the year 96 &#8211; last fall I gave him 10 more in Iron works &amp;c. to try him once more<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He assured me then he would behave well &amp; Now he tells me that he has no more than 30 Skins at his Lodge<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I <span class="AddHand-author">have</span> abused him to the last degree for his laziness &#8211; Yet he seems quite pleased &amp; has</p>
