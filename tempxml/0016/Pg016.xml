<p style="text-align:justify;">Tuesday 14<sup>th</sup> Jan<sup>ry</sup> 1800.  As I think it high time since S<sup>t</sup> Germain has taken another hunter to send up M<sup>r</sup> Wentzel without any longer waiting the different Expresses' arrival this morning I sent Lambert for Mandeville to the Little Island to set off with him for the Forks after tomorrow as this Man offered himself the last Time he was here<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  After Dark two young Men arrived from the Beaver whom they left in Slave River<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Beaver sent them to ask if Pierre Labri was arrived and to tell that if he was not yet arrived that he would be ashamed<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A fine time indeed to enquire after him &#8211; a month after he left them<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Reprimanded them for allowing him to come alone to the Fort<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They said it was that bad Man called the Beaver's fault for they were like slaves to him &amp; could do nothing without his Consent<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave them a piece Tob<sup>c</sup> &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednesday 15<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Beaver sent by these young men 22 Skins of his Credits and also 3 Skins worth fresh Meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave them each a piece of Tobacco a flint &amp;c &amp; sent the Beaver 1½ foot of Tobacco w<sup>t</sup> repeated assurances that if he behaved well &amp; came to the fort at the usual season that Nothing would be done him worse than paying whatever he brought beside his Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I know if I don't clear myself by giving proper reasons for my <span class="AddHand-author">thus</span> Countenancing the Contributors of a Man's Death that I will run the risk to be severely censured by the Divines &amp; moralists of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Age</span> as well as of the Country in which I live<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I must therefore tell these devout Gentlemen in as few words as I can that could I have considered myself as a private Man divested of any other employment or duty than that of a Man then I would not do what I have done &#8211; but being a Clerk of the North West Company bound to forward their Interest in every respect to the utmost of my power I could not in Conscience think it consistent with my Duty or their Interest to make them lose a pack or two by ill treating these Indians for the sake of a Man who never gained them a farthing in his Life<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Michel Cadien &amp; one of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">whitefish's</span> Sons in Law arrived<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They slept 6 Nights &amp; left the whitefish with his Son &amp; Son in Law below the Rapides in Slave River &amp; say they have about half their Cr<sup>s</sup>.  Lambert arrived from the Little Island<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mandeville was at the old Fort but <span style="text-decoration:underline;">les</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gens</span> de <span style="text-decoration:underline;">la</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maison</span> said he would be there to Night &amp; promised to send him here tomorrow<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I told Lambert that he would not come tomorrow from my Knowledge of their Character which was or is always to tell Lies &#8211; this Lambert denied with all the Vehemence of a Frenchman upon which Michel Cadien offerd to take Mandeville&#8217;s place by going to the Forks<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 16<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This Morning Ch<sup>s</sup> Cadien's Comrade arrived &amp; paid 62 skins peltries &amp; 4 D<sup>o</sup> M<sup>t</sup> Credits<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He was so haughty on his arrival on acc<sup>t</sup> of his Skins that he thr<span class="AddHand-editors">[ew]</span> the Tob<sup>c</sup> I gave him in my face saying it was not good &amp; that I lied when I said there was none better in the Fort<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Mens advice tho' not asked was to poke the piece of Tob<sup>c</sup> in to the Indian's Nose or give him a Kicking for his ill breeding which from Mons<sup>r</sup> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maclause</span> or Mons<sup>r</sup> Mackancie woul<span class="AddHand-editors">[d]</span> meet with this punishment<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This rough usage I thought a</p>
