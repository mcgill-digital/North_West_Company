<p style="text-align:justify;">bad encouragement for him to kill more Beaver and a very indifferent recompense for those he had already brought which I think made ample amends for his insult &#8211; however in case he might do the like again perhaps when he had no Such atonement I told him to take care &amp; not behave so impudently again<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Soon after 2 Montagners arrived from their Lands &#8211; one of them Narrelliazé paid 36 Sk<sup>s</sup> Cr<sup>s</sup> in Peltries &amp; traded 12 D<sup>o</sup>, 2½ Sk<sup>s</sup> Carribou Meat, 1 Skin Grease, 3 Carriboux Skins dressed &amp; 2 Small old axes for 1 sk<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Traded w<sup>th</sup> the other Indians 7 skins fresh Meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave them a few more Credits with the usual articles for nothing<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Sent the old Whitefish as I understand he works well 3 feet Tob<sup>c</sup> which is none of the best<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It is now very late and Mandeville is not yet come<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 17<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Early this Morning sent Little Cadien to the Little Island for two of the Company's Dogs to go to the Forks &#8211; he returned soon after having met Mandeville &amp; Vermette at LaBri's point where they returned to the Little Island &amp; he came back with Masquaw<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He says that Mandeville told him that he was brave in undertaking to go to the Forks with M<sup>r</sup> Wentzel without a Man to beat the road for him &#8211; &amp; he also told him that he did not offer to go to the Forks the last time he was here<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Gave Cadien 1 Carrot of Tob<sup>c</sup> on Mandeville's Accompt for going in his place<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The least thing I think he should have done would be to come to the Fort since he came so far, to tell his reasons for refusing to do his Duty as well as his Motives in Denying that he offer&#8217;d to do it in this respect<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It is an invariable rule of mine never to refuse any of them without giving good reasons for it so as to please them and never to deny them any favor whatever that I can confer without hurting the Comp<sup>y's</sup> Interest<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I think myself therefore entitled to a like attention from them &amp; whenever they fail in this or in discharging their Duty (willingly) I shall punish either as I have done at the expense of their wages let Critics in Trade &amp; the Bon Garçons mal apropos say what they please<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  When Lambert was at the Little Island all the Men there were so disobliging as to refuse going <span class="AddHand-author">to</span> the Forks without being asked<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  F. Labri in particular said he would not go for less than 200 Livres<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This Mans pains must be very precious indeed since for going 8 Days march he exacts as much as a Man of Common abilities can expect for a half year's Service<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  For my part I cannot comprehend the reason why these Men engage to do whatever they are told for a yearly sum of Money and yet fancy themselves at Liberty to refuse to do the greatest triffle without a reward &amp; a Man to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">beat them</span> a road<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A person would find himself in a pretty pickle with a parcel of such fellows in an Opposition<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  There is I think as much severity required to prepare them for such an Emergence as there is lenity necessary to prepare the Montagners for it &#8211; &amp; it would be as much against the Interest to let Mandeville's refusal pass unpunish as it would be to have beaten that Indian who threw the Tob<sup>c</sup> in my face<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
