<p style="text-align:justify;">some American horse on the way up, about ½ an hour elapsed, &amp; finding that no horse made their appearance I sent Tromp ashore with orders to proceed down as far as Sambrinards &amp; not to return unless he saw the enemy advancing &#8211; he has not been long absent from the Vessel when a crowd appeared on the bank below the vessel which I immeadiately took for the americans &amp; was determined from the first alarm to blow the vessel up, this made Cap<sup>t</sup> Maxwell hurry with his family ashore, there was another female passenger who was left on the beach the passengers were now all absent from the vessel, (the boat had just got along side) when they were all made prisoners on shore &#8211; I soon after saw a canoe crossing below with a white flag &amp; as full as they could cram soon after which was about 1 PM <span class="AddHand-author">so</span>me person sung out from the woods to surrender the vessel, that my property &amp; that of the mens should not be touched &#8211; I hailed in turn to know Whom it was then the person stepped out, &amp; again repeated the same thing &#8211; the wind had been light all the morning, but there was now a little more &amp; strong enough at times to stem the current, we were some times sailing &amp; often obliged to come too, when Beaubien hailed &amp; we were under weigh &amp; had gained about 3 cable lengths, I went to him with the boat to know more particularly what he wanted, he again repeated what he had already said, &amp; likewise no part of the private or publick property should be saved, I asked an hour to give my answer I ret<sup>d</sup> to the vessel &#8211; got both guns on the larboard side, (the vessel was now at anchor &amp; asked my men if they would surrender or fight &amp; defend the vessel &#8211; they all one after the other said they would &#8211; upon which I went back to BeauBien gave him my answer, he then said if I attempted to go out of the river he would fire on me the moment I should heave up, to which I replyed I would return the fire, he said he had fifty men, I went back to the vessel, hung the Boat in the tackles hove up &amp; while fishing the anchor they gave us a volley which we immeadiately returned &amp; kept it up for a good Quarter of an hour (the Vessel all the time barely going ahead with a light air at SW course abou<span class="AddHand-editors">[t]</span> NNW &#8211;) they then ceassed &amp; went off whether for want of powder or that we had killed or wounded any of them I know not, about sun set we came to the foot of the rappid &amp; got a tracking, but were obliged to anchor after being about 2 hours trying to get up for want of wind, about 10 PM Reaume came to the vessel with a letter from Beaubien on the same purpose.
