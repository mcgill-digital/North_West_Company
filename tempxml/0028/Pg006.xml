<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednessday 19<sup>th</sup> November <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1800</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Cold day, the Indians are all Sober, but do not go off today<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Frisé came back from the Hunters who say they cannot follow the Animals they wound, the ground being so hard frozen, they have no markes of where they tread<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[A]</span> young Indian killed a Swan in the River close by the House, <span class="AddHand-editors">[t]</span>he poor Bird had at least Six pounds of ice sticking to one of its wings &#8211; it kept in the Rapids, as the only part not covered with ice, &amp; no doubt would soon have perished with the Cold tho' not very poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 20<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A Cold, stormy morning<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Snowed from Nine oClock A.M. untill 2 oClock P.M. in which a Short space of time there fell between four and five Inches Snow<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Indians did not stir owing to the Badness of the weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Frêne's wife is greatly better, tho' still unable to walk<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This snow is come very opportunely for us, as our hunters could not Kill, &amp; that all our piece meat is almost entirely out, &amp; I should be very Sorry to be obliged to make use of the little pounded meat we have at present<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 21<sup>st</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A fine Clear day, all the Indians went off excepting the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Frêne</span>.  Jacque, alias Maron, came from the Hunters to acquaint us they have kill'd 4 Red Deer; I Sold the Grey Colt to La Rose for 100<sup>lb</sup> G.P. Cy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saturday 22<sup>d</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Mild weather, the Frêne went off this morning, &#8211; his wife being able to walk<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I Sent 4 men for the four red deer that are at our Hunters lodges to whom I sent some Amunition &amp; to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Petit</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Corbau</span> a Strip'd Blanket<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I delivered the Blanket to La Rose with derections to deliver it, but he gave it to carry to N. Ducharm, who on his arrival at the lodges put the Blanket in the Branches &amp; there forgot it, &amp; to crown the matter in their great hurry to get back to night they did not load their horses, well by which means a part of the meat remained<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  La Rose being the only one I saw, got a Severe reprehension for his carelessness, in respect of the Blanket &amp; their leaving a part of the meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I told him I Should charge the Blanket to his A/C untill I learned whither it is lost or not.  <span class="AddHand-editors">[H]</span>e means to return tomorrow, to learn the fate of the Blanket, &amp; fetch the remainder of the meat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sunday 23<sup>d</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A Cold, windy day<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  La Rose went for the Meat that remain'd at the Hunter's, of whom<span class="DelHand-author">e</span> one (Petit Corbau) came to the house &amp; told us he had kill'd a Doe red Deer; he brought the Six Beaver for the Blanket, I Sent yesterday, but what his most material business at the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort</span> was to get Liquor<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I gave for him &amp; the 2 others three Gall. mix'd, &amp; told him they should have no more untill they kill'd ten Animals &amp; that then I would give them 2 Gall. for nothing, &amp; so during the winter for every ten Animals they Kill they are to have 2 Gall. M. Rum<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I Sent Vallé for the other beast, that he kill'd<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Indeed we stand in need of victuals for within this week we have an addition of two strangers, &#8211; two of the men's women being brought to bed the one of a Boy, the other a Girl &#8211; and still there is a third ready to <span class="AddHand-editors">[t]</span>umble to pieces.</p>
