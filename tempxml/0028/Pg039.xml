<p style="text-align:justify;">Sunday 17<sup>th</sup> May 1801<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We Sett off as Soon as it was light to follow the people who could not cross at the usual crossing place off the S. River the water being so extremely high that all the points were entirely under water, &amp; never did I See such heavy roads, as we passed through our light horses had great difficulty to draw their legs out of the Mire<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[I]</span>t rained, thundered, &amp; lightened at a terrible rate untill noon when we came up with the men at the entrance of the large Plain<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Soon after we got up with the people the weather cleared up &amp; we Sett off all in a band, but we Soon were stopt by a River that runs from the South Mountain, which is very rapid &amp; at present very deep, we made a Raft, &amp; by the help of lines on either side we crossed our loads<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[A]</span>n hour before Sun-Sett we pitched for the night at the Eastern extremity of the Plains<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Monday 18<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A very boisterous morning<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[W]</span>e passed, through hills &amp; bays incessantly for three leagues before we got to M<sup>r</sup> Perigne's which we reached before noon, when the weather got very fine; we crossed our effects with a Small wooden Canoe, we took three additional Horses at M<sup>r</sup> Perignes with what goods &amp; Furs remained there<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I immediately dispatched Bellile on my arrival with a few lines for M<sup>r</sup> Harmon, requesting him to Send a large Canoe to meet us from Swan River, but my Messenger did not go far having met three men who with three others M<sup>r</sup> Harmon Sent off with a large Canoe the 15<sup>th</sup> Inst. to proceed as far up the river as possible to meet me, but by the Hieght of the water &amp; badness of the Canoe they could get no higher up than the place called the Drap Rouge<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[A]</span>fter crossing over the Swan River we were under the necessity to make a bride over an other Small but deep River, it is really incredible the quantity of water in every brook, creek, &amp; even in the road<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[W]</span>e put up at the Prairie de Travers to night where we found excellent grazing for our Horses<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Teusday 19<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Fine weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We got to the Canoes, (LeFevre having made one of Parchement) a couple of hours before Sun Set, &amp; it was full time as most of the Horses were very much fatigued.  Our men caught a great many Carps in the rapids of which we ate a hearty Supper<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[T]</span>he men tell me the Houses at Swan River had two feet water on their floors, when the water rose, &amp; that they had not a Dry bit of ground, within three or four leagues of the Fort all round the overflowing of the River having laid all underwater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednessday 20<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I embarked in the Bark or Large Canoe well loaded &amp; the people drove the Horses, for the could not ride<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I left three men with the Skin Canoe to wait for M<sup>r</sup> Perigné as he is comming down with a wooden one<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[W]</span>e crossed the people at the two different crossing places, &amp; got to the Fort late in the evening, where the River still overflows the banks, &amp; there is water on the House floor as yet; I found neither the Canoes begun, nor the press in order as I had derected, for which I did not blame M<sup>r</sup> Harmon, he being not fully acquainted with the requisites for both.</p>
