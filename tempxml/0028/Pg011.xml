<p style="text-align:justify;">Monday 15<sup>th</sup> December <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1800</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It was one of the finest mornings I ever saw, the Sun Shone forth in all its brightness, &amp; the weather was so very mild, that if it had not been for the little Snow that covers the ground one on going out of rooms would have been apt to imagine he had lain asleep for five months &amp; at last awakened in the cheerful month of May, but like all other Sublunary things it soon changed, for about noon it began to blow a mere hurrycane, the Sky got overcast &amp; every thing appeared gloomy that a few hours ago, (nay a few minutes) appeared gay, &amp; gilded with the animating Rays of the Great Parent of Day!  Such is the instability of earthly enjoyments!</p>

I gave the Vent du Nord as much rum as he could drink, as I am very apprehensive he &amp; the rest of the band mean to go to Lower Fort des Prairies, they hearing such tempting accounts of how goods, &amp; liquor are lavished on the Indians that go there both by our people &amp; the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Petit</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Poté</span> as well as the Hudson's Bay C<sup>os</sup> Servants<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Our Hunter's boy came home to inform us of their having Kill'd 2 Red Deer &amp; a Bear<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Frise &amp; Vallé arrived from the River Qui Appelle they brought me letters from Mess<sup>rs</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Donell &amp; Malhiot, as likewise one from M<sup>r</sup> Bunn who winters for the H.B.
