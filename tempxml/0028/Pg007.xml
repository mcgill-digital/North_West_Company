Roy is pretty well recovered, as is Ducharme, &amp; Carron.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Teusday 25<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A very mild day, the most of the Snow melted today<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I Sent E. Ducharm for the Red Deer that the hunters kill'd Sunday, La Rose &amp; N. Ducharm I Sent to look for Birch to make chairs; Vallé went to get wood for a Sledge, Roy took a Doze of Physic, I scolded Girardan for some Stupid observations of his, to M<sup>r</sup> Harmon &amp; Collin, he is making me a pair of Deer skin Trowsers, Old Parant, is busy making a Slay to haul the fire wood home with, Danis is making a Couple of window Shutters<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednessday 26<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A fine day<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I took Collin &amp; an other man with me &amp; went to the Indian Elbow (Recoude) expecting to find some Indians there of whom I have heard for a long time past, not a Single word, or at least learn from Sutherland whether he has Seen any of them<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I Slept at M<sup>r</sup> Sutherland's &amp; had the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Honor</span> of playing <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cribbage</span> with Jeanny, (his wife)<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[H]</span>e poor Devil complains bitterly of M<sup>r</sup> Goodwin's usage of him, in Sending him no <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Goodys</span>, but what he had he made me very wellcome to<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I am pretty well convinced he has seen none of the Indians I was uneasy about.  There is very little Snow remaining in the plains, for it has thaw'd a good deal these two days<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thursday 27<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Still fine weather<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We Set off home after breakfast &amp; found every thing in Statu Quo<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friday 28<sup>th</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Mildness of the weather makes me fear very much that provisions will be equally Scarce and Dear as last year<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I Sent off La Rose, Carron, &amp; Roy's Step Son, to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tounerre's</span> tent for his Skins a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Second</span> time, with a Message if they did not give them their furs that I Should go myself, &amp; that I would take them, I sent not even a bit of Tobacco<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Three Stone Indians arrived, of whom the Red Mooss is the principall, they Seem to have very little of any thing, I gave them a few pints of Liquor, &amp; they traded a few more<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Old La Voye (Free man) came to the Fort, he has not seen a Human Phisiognomy since Le Mire went for 100 Skins of his in September last by my orders, since which time he has Kill'd 40 more but did not bring them with him<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  L'Heureux, &amp; Dauphiné, &amp; with them Bellile came here from the Montaigne des Oisaux<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Dauphine broke a new Gun he was bringing up from the Lower Fort, which I have charged to his account<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Bellile told me about the Keg of H. Wines they made free with when they remained behind, he owns that he &amp; <span class="AddHand-editors">[B<sup>te</sup>]</span> La France Drank it, I mean to charge it to the account of La France as he was the foreman of the Canoe<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Fran<sup>s</sup> Roy is unwell I gave him a Doze of physic to take tomorrow morning.</p>
