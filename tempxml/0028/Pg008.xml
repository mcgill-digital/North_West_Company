<p style="text-align:justify;">La Rose &amp; Piquaquit remained<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Hunter's little Boy came home to inform us that they have kill'd Seven Red Deer.  <span class="AddHand-editors">[T]</span>his has been every bit as fine a Day as yesterday, tho' Cloudy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sunday 30<sup>th</sup> November <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1800</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Quite Mild, but Cloudy fell a few grains Snow, indeed it looked all day as if it would rain.  Being S<sup>t</sup> Andrew's day, the men presented me with a Cross, &amp; I in return presented them with a quart of H. Wines<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I have made it a rule ever since I have been at this place (3 years) to give no drams on any occation, by that means I always have reconciled it to myself, &amp; circumstances, to let them have a little debauch the latter end of Nov<sup>r</sup> or beginning of Dec<sup>r</sup>, it foremerly was customary to give them a little liquor on putting up a flag staff &amp; after they had finished either the Fort or Houses, neither of which times I give them anything; In short I gave them a quart H.W. in the morning in Drams, &amp; 2 quarts in the evening mix'd with water &amp; Sugar, as they danced, till three oClock in the morning to Frisé's singing, but in course of the day a parcel of them bought each a pint of rum which Kept their heads pretty warm all day, &amp; occationed a few Battles among themselves.  One of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cut</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lip's</span> widows came here, today<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  She goes to the plains in search of her <span style="text-decoration:underline;">relations</span>; Collin was out along with one of the men all day looking for Birch to make Slays, but found none fit for that purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Monday 1<sup>st</sup> December <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1800</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A Mild day, Cloudy, and really strange weather, for daily it drops a few grains of either Snow or hail, but neither, so as to cover the earth sufficiently for Sledges to run, or mark the footsteps of Animals, enough for the Hunters.  Roy's step Son, came from the Tonnerre's, he Says La Rose will come home tomorrow, but does not know whether he'll bring what they went for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I Sent M<sup>r</sup> Harmon for Meat with the Men, the man who remained at the Hunter's is come back this evening, (Jacque)<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Teusday 2<sup>d</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A very mild, Cloudy, day<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The men came home with the meat<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Hunter's boys came, with them to trade Six Beaver Sks. La Rose came from the Tonnerre's but could not get the Skins from them, they send me word not to be apprehensive of their going to the H. Bay people at the Elbow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednessday 3<sup>d</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Rather colder than usual, but still Cloudy<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I Sent Carron to remain at the Hunter's for a fortnight, B<span class="AddHand-editors">[el]</span>lile set off for home (Montaigne des Oiseaux), I Sent Perigné a Padlock, by him<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Old La Voye untied his Skins that Le Mire brought here in October he had in all 93 Beavers, &amp; 7 Otters, of which he paid Credit, &amp; traded 43, consequently there still remains 64<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I agreed to lend him a horse to go for the forty he left, behind him when he set off to come to the Fort, he wishes to remain at the Fort to pass the winter, which I am obliged to accord to for fear of disobledging him.
