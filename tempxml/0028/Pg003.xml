<p class="positiveIndent">That the Occurrencies, &amp; events, of which this is destined to be the testimonial, may prove, prosperous, &amp; pleasant, in the same degree that the uneasy writer is agitated, by anxious, and fervent wishes; is the Sincere prayer of one, who by no means regards, himself, as acting for or persuing his own private interest, but is spurred, and actuated, by reflecting, that he is entrusted with, not only the property but confidence, of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On his arrival here last Fall, the writer of these lines entertained the most Sanguine, &amp; lively hopes, of converting the property he brought into the Swan River to good account, by the following Separation of it<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He intended to leave a few pieces for the Expenditure of Swan River House, as there are 2 Indians only there, with La Verdure (the Guide) to take care of the property &amp;c.  Perigné with 15 P<sup>cs</sup> Goods, Liquor, &amp;c, was settled for the Montaigne des Oiseaux with 6 Indians, &amp; as M<sup>r</sup> Sutherland for the H. Bay's C<sup>o</sup> winters at the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Recoude</span> it was projected to send M<sup>r</sup> Harmon with some person there, to have a little amunition &amp; rum in case any of our debtors should go to see the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">English</span> or rather the Hudson's Bay C<sup>os</sup> Servants there<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  In the Month of December he Intended Sending people with a few pieces goods &amp;c to settle at the nut Lake, &amp; he himself to move from Alexandria there, if, &amp; when ever necessary; but the last of these plans viz<sup>t</sup> the purposed establishment at the nut lake was knocked in the head, as was the plan for Sending people to the Elbow, by the arrival of M<sup>r</sup> Harrison from River a la Biche with a letter from M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Gillis where in he mentions if he has not sent him one half of the Goods &amp; Liquor originally brought to Swan River, (for his demands amount to that) &amp; a number of men, the opposition (or the XY) will make as many packs as he will, &amp; as every other consideration must give way to that it of course Superseded the Idea of making so many establishments<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Visit made To Fort Dauphin between the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 27<sup>th</sup> of October, by the Schemer of the above mention'd Plans, he found that a demand for a quantity of Goods &amp; Liquor would be made on him for the four Posts established there.  In fact the apparent Scarcity of Goods, liquor &amp;c. throughout the whole of the Department fills his mind with the greatest anxiety and mor<span class="AddHand-editors">[e]</span> severe aprehension for the consequences; But Lays his trust in Go<span class="AddHand-editors">[d]</span></p>
