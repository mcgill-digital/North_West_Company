<p class="head">Mississouri by M<sup>r</sup> Ch<sup>s</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Kenzie &#8211; 1805</p>
<p class="positiveIndent">In the course of our first trip to the Mississouri having seen several Rocky Mountain Indians we made inquiries of the state of their Country regarding Trade &#8211; And learned that Beavers were as numerous in their Rivers as Buffaloes were in their plains which amount was confirmed by <span class="DelHand-author">old</span> Menard an Old Canadian who had lately been rambling among the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this information M<sup>r</sup> Chaboillez was decidedly of opinion that an advantageous trade could be established in that quarter.  He therefore lost no time in forming a plan.  <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque was appointed to carry it into execution &amp; I was ordered to accompany him as far as the Mandanes<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon the 3<sup>d</sup> of June every thing was in readiness the party took their departure.  It consisting of M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque<span class="AddHand-editors">[,]</span> Lafrance<span class="AddHand-editors">[,]</span> two men and myself provided with thirteen horses<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="DelHand-author">Soo</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon after, accidentally, falling in with a large band of Assiniboines we experienced some difficulty to get clear <span class="AddHand-author">of them</span> with our Property in safety.  This was the same band that pillaged the Hudson Bay men the foregoing fall.  The Chief is a rascal<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We Knew his weakness &#8211; he was bribed and we escaped unhurt<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="Gap">[&#8230;]</span> arrived</span> scarcely <span class="AddHand-author">arrived</span> on the Banks of the Mississouri when the Gros Ventres sent Canoes to ferry us over to their villages where we were much surprised to find the whole <span class="AddHand-author">of the people</span> with blackened faces and the Young men <span class="DelHand-author">dancing &amp; singing</span> <span class="AddHand-author">singing &amp; dancing</span> round the village with an <span class="DelHand-author">In</span> <span class="AddHand-author">Indian</span> scalp<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a great change in dress &#8211; which in many instances consisted of Articles never used among distant tribes of Indians viz. Russia Shirting trousers.  Swansdown vests,  Corduroy Jackets, fine Calico Shirts</p>
