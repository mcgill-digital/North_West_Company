<p style="text-align:justify;">They were all on horseback<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Children at the breast were lashed to the saddle &#8211; and all from the age of six could manage a horse.  <span class="DelHand-author">Most of</span> The Women had wooden saddles; most of the men had none.  There were great many horses for the Baggage and the whole might form a cavalcade of more than Two thousand<span class="DelHand-author">s</span> which covered a large space and had the appearance of an army.  They halted on a rising ground behind the village and formed into a circle<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Chief addressed them <span class="AddHand-author">and</span> <span class="DelHand-author">before</span> they des<span class="AddHand-author">c</span>ended the hill full speed <span class="DelHand-author">the same as if the d<span class="AddHand-author">e</span>vil was after them</span> &#8211; <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> <span class="AddHand-author">&amp;</span> rode through the villages shewing their dexterity in a thousand <span class="DelHand-author">ways</span> <span class="AddHand-author">shapes</span>; the same as in a circus for <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">that of</span></span> horsemanship.  I was astonished to see their agility and address and I do believe the Rocky Mountain Indians are the best riders in the world<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All dressed in leather they looked <span class="DelHand-author">neat and clean</span> <span class="AddHand-author">clean &amp; </span><span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">handsome</span></span><span class="AddHand-author"> neat</span>.  They were adorned with a few Christian <span class="DelHand-author">ornaments</span> articles; more trif<span class="DelHand-author">f</span>les such as beads rings &amp;<sup>c</sup>.  Their arms consist of bows &amp; arrows, lances &#8211; round stones inclosed in leather and slung to a shank in the form of a Whip<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They use shields occasionally and have a few guns<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On The ensuing day, the Mississouri Indians dressed in their best fineries, returned the compliment by a similar exhibition.  These from their vicinity to trading Establishments were better provided with necessaries and made a more warlike appearance:&#8211; but were inferior in the management of <span class="AddHand-author">their</span> horses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the mean time the Great chief la <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Borgne</span>, according to promise sent for us in order to introduce M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque to the Rocky Mountain chief whose name is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nakesinia</span> or Red Calf.  When we offered to shake hands with the great man called the Red Calf he did not understand our meaning and stood motionless until he was informed that shaking hands was the signal of friendship among White men and he immediately stretched forth both his hands to receive ours <span class="DelHand-author">salutation</span>.</p>
