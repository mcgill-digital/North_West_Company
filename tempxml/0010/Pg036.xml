They made a good hunt upon the upper parts <span class="DelHand-author">of the</span> of the Mississouri &#8211; <span class="DelHand-author">they</span> paid their debts and traded many furs which they had over and above.  The Indians were equally successful; so that my stock in trade was soon expended to advantage<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  But an appointment <span class="DelHand-author">with</span> with a man sent from The Fort to deal with the Panees detained me for a longer period than I <span class="AddHand-author">had</span> expected<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this interval a band of the Shayans arrived at the villages with offers of Peace<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They were received with demonstrations of friendship; and handsomely entertained for many days.  At their departure they were informed that a Young man of their nation taken prisoner <span class="AddHand-author">in war</span> some Years before would be given <span class="DelHand-author">be given</span> up to his father whenever he should <span class="DelHand-author">come for him</span> <span class="AddHand-author">appear </span><span class="DelHand-author"><span class="Gap">[&#8230;]</span></span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Soon after the father came accompanied by Several young <span class="AddHand-author">men</span>.
