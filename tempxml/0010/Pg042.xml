<p style="text-align:justify;">were taken away.  At the expiration of the period fixed we took our departure<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Several Shayans accompanied us in order to invite the Mississouri Indians particularly the Borgne &#8211; for whom they <span class="DelHand-author">they</span> had <span class="DelHand-author">the</span><span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">a</span></span> <span class="AddHand-author">the</span> skin of a white Buffaloe<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We got home the third day &#8211; and found my friend M<sup>r</sup> Caldwell greatly concerned about our safety &#8211; our absence happening to be longer than <span class="DelHand-author">they had</span> <span class="AddHand-author">was</span> expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After many councils the Borgne and a few of his Young men accompanied the Shayans<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> We turned our thoughts upon home &#8211; and began to prepare for our Departure<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  In a few days I was surprized to hear my name repeated at the door of the tent by a voice which seemed familiar to my ear<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Dressed as I was in the Indian Costume I flew to the door and to my great astonishment found M<sup>r</sup> Ch<sup>s</sup> Chaboillez, M<sup>r</sup> Alexander Henry and M<sup>r</sup> Allen MacDonell with three <span class="DelHand-author">voyageurs</span> of their voyageurs standing before me<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The first salutation of these gentlemen was a reproof for my dress &#8211; which I found <span class="DelHand-author">more comf</span> convenient &#8211; let the Idea of savage be taken away and <span class="DelHand-author">that</span> <span class="AddHand-author">my</span> dress was more suitable than any other to my present situation<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  With <span class="AddHand-author">that</span> dress I could pass and repass as often as I pleased through the villages unmolested whereas a Christian dress would subject me to the continual gaze <span class="DelHand-author">of the Indians</span> and <span class="AddHand-author">even</span> ridicule of the Natives<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I immediately announced the <span class="DelHand-author">eminence</span> <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">distinction</span></span> <span class="AddHand-author">quality</span> of the strangers to the standers by &#8211; the great news flew like lightening through the villages and in a moment all the men women and children that could crawl thronged to see the White Chiefs whom they were so often taught to admire at a distance<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Indians seemed not free of disappointment &#8211; they looked at the strangers with unconcern but invited them to their Lodges and we dispersed<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
