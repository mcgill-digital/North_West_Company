<p style="text-align:justify;">This was in the month of February &#8211; and the first <span class="DelHand-author">day</span> <span class="AddHand-author">fair</span> day we took our leave of the Mississouri with <span class="DelHand-author">had</span> ten horses loaded with property and provisions<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We went on until dark in hopes of falling in with a good spot of grass to feed our horses &#8211; but the plains having been burnt in the fall and covered with Buffaloes all winter the whole country was as bare as the palm of the hand and scarcely a sprig of grass was to be seen in any direction.  We encamp<span class="DelHand-author">t</span>ed in a swamp of dry rushes cleared a small space from snow lighted a fire with small bit<span class="DelHand-author">t</span>s of dry wood which we had provided for the purpose and having eaten some corn Cakes and drank some snow water we laid our selves down to rest.  It snowed much in the night and we found ourselves very comfortable under it <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="Gap">[&#8230;]</span></span> <span class="AddHand-author">but</span> the air was raw.  Next morning, when we got up seven of our horses were missing and could not be found in the vicinity<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  We therefore covered our baggage with snow, mounted our <span class="DelHand-author">three</span> horses and returned to the villages<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Here we learned that <span class="DelHand-author">our</span> <span class="AddHand-author">that the</span> horses <span class="AddHand-author">which were missing</span> were in the possession of an Indian<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="AddHand-editors">[W]</span>e went to <span class="DelHand-author">his</span> <span class="AddHand-author">this Indians</span> Lodge <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> he readily gave them up <span class="AddHand-author">to us</span> and we passed the night in his lodge, where we were treated with Kindness.  The ensuing morning we sat out &#8211; found our baggage safe &#8211; loaded our horses and continued our course till night came on &#8211; but seeing no appearance of wood for <span class="AddHand-author">fire</span> nor grass for provender I desired Mor<span class="DelHand-author">r</span>ison who led the way to go on and guide his course by the North Pole<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The other man did not seem <span class="AddHand-author">to be</span> at his ease however he said nothing but soon after began to lag behind<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The snow</p>
