<p style="text-align:justify;">In the course of this slow progress we performed many little ceremonies<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  At length two Shayans came to meet us from their camp<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The chief presented them with the pipe<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  After taking three whiffs each they clapped their hands upon their breasts conveying an idea that their hearts were glad<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  By and by the great Chief and a suite of two hundred horsemen appeared &#8211; the suite passed to our rear.  The Chief <span class="AddHand-author">who was upon a fine white horse</span> stopped at our Chief stripped himself entirely naked &#8211; dressed our Chief in his dress mounted him <span class="AddHand-author">in his place</span> upon th<span class="AddHand-author">e</span> <span class="DelHand-author">wh</span> <span class="AddHand-author">white</span> horse &#8211; which he l<span class="DelHand-author">a</span><span class="AddHand-author">e</span>d by the bridle <span class="DelHand-author">in one hand</span> holding the sacred pipe; <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> <span class="AddHand-author">&amp; </span>singing a slow air. <span class="DelHand-author">until we</span> <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">&amp;</span></span>  In this manner <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="AddHand-author">he</span></span><span class="AddHand-author"> we</span> entered the Camp<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strangers I perceived Kept their eyes continually upon me and I found <span class="AddHand-author">them</span> otherwise extremely attentive<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Shayanne Camp consisted of two hundred and twenty leather tents as white as snow &#8211; enclosing a circle of many acres and situated upon an elevation near the banks of a beautiful river<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  On my arrival I was conducted by a Chief to his own lodge through the recommendation of the Borgne <span class="AddHand-author">who was</span> my reputed father<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This Chief was Kind to me &#8211; after giving me to eat of the best that could be procured &#8211; he recommended to such of his friends as had furs to <span class="DelHand-author">carry</span> <span class="AddHand-author">bring</span> them &#8211; and in a moment <span class="DelHand-author">all</span> my little stock of goods was <span class="DelHand-author">disposed of to great advantage</span> <span class="AddHand-author">gone</span><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I now paid a visit to Mons<sup>r</sup> Jissaume &#8211; who was in bad humour<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He had exposed his great pipe &#8211; but nothing was thrown upon it<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  "Your friend the chief 'said he' has harangued all the trade into his lodge, <span class="DelHand-author">for you</span>, to my prejudice<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>"</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Camp made themselves very agreeable and our party consented to remain six days and these six days passed away very pleasantly<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  In one hunting party to which I was witness no less than two hundred and fifty Buffalos were Killed and left to rot within twenty acres of the Camp &#8211; only the tongues</p>
