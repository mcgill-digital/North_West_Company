<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Corbeau tribe were upon the eve of their departure Le Borgne sent word to M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque to make ready and join them<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="DelHand-author">And</span> M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque immediately set about arranging his matters for the Journey which the Gros ventres perceiving they crowded into our quarters and threatened M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque with the effect of their displeasure if he persisted in his design<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  At this moment the great Chief entered with a battle axe in his hand<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  He stared around <span class="AddHand-author">him</span> and with an imperious air asked the Indians present why so many of them were assembled there<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They answered that they were there only to take their last farewell of the White men whom they never expected to see again.  "Why," said the Chief with a sneer,&#8211; <span class="AddHand-editors">["]</span>If the White people have a mind to die that is nothing to us<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  You have often enough warned them of the danger.  Yet they will go on."  The Indians <span class="AddHand-author">in a moment</span> sneaked out of the way &#8211; and we accompanied the Chief <span class="DelHand-author">to the Corbeaux's Camp</span> M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque leading his horse by the bridle<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  When we entered the Camp <span class="AddHand-author">of the Corbeauxs</span> many of the tribe signified their disapprobation of M<sup>r</sup> La Rocques intention and we could hear them exclaim "Where are You going White people.  Return &#8211; go home <span class="DelHand-author">to Your friends</span>.  We do not wish for Your Company.  Many of our Young men are without sense; <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> We are afraid."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their unfavorable appearances had no effect upon M<sup>r</sup> La Rocque<span class="AddHand-editors">[s]</span> resolution<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  But one of the men who was to have been of the party thought he found himself indisposed and applied for leave to remain with me<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  "I see plainly your sickness" 'said M<sup>r</sup> La R' you are an old woman &#8211; You may therefore remain<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>"  This unexpected discovery of the fellows weakness threw him into a violent passion and he was very abusive<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  However M<sup>r</sup> La R. <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> took no notice <span class="AddHand-author">of</span> this conduct &#8211; for he could not punish so much insolence before so many strange Indians without injury<span class="DelHand-author">ing</span> <span class="AddHand-author">to some of</span> our engagements<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
