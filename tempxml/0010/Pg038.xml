<p style="text-align:justify;">thing we do at such a long distance from our village as he resides<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Is he a Spirit?  Is he taller than the Hills?  He must be like a Mountain and have eyes like the sun &#8211; <span class="DelHand-author">he must be clothed <span class="AddHand-author">dressed</span> in scarlet</span> &#8211; he has plenty of scarlet cloth &#8211; he gives scarlet cloth for Beaver &#8211; he must be dressed in scarlet cloth himself<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>"  I was at a loss how to take this observation<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I could not discern whether it was meant in Joke or in earnest<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  However the chief immediately after gave me a Young man to assist me in the journey<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I took three of the Companys horses &#8211; one for myself one for my Young man and one <span class="DelHand-author">loaded</span> for the goods.  Next morning at dawn I joined the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rattle Snake</span> (for that was the name of the Young war chief) and his party at the next village<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Passing through the village I could hear the Indians say among themselves that I had no sense &#8211; the women in particular seemed greatly concerned in my welfare;  and they told me repeatedly I should never return<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we assembled <span class="DelHand-author">and</span> were out of the village our party consisted of the Rattle Snake twelve young Scamps of his tribe ten Shayanns and some of the Mandanes; <span class="DelHand-author"><span class="Gap">[&#8230;]</span> were</span> in all about forty<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Among the Mandanes was a M<sup>r</sup> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Jissaume</span> who informed me that he was going to the Shayannes <span style="text-decoration:underline;">En pipe</span> and that he was sure of being well received<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  For said he the Shayannes do not Know how to trade: therefore if You wish for success, You must follow my example.  I told him no;&#8211; that I would trade regularly, or keep my property, and leave nothing to chance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At night the Rattle Snake and his Young men were rather down in the mouth &#8211; and began to question me about my intentions &#8211; and the manner I was disposed to act in case of an attack from an enemy<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They asked me for ammunition<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This demand I would not satisfy for the moment &#8211; but assured them</p>
