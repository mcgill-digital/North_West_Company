<p style="text-align:justify;">When I returned to my lodge the principal men <span class="DelHand-author">of</span> of the village assembled around me and began to remark that the great chiefs in the Spanish Settlements were clo<span class="DelHand-author">a</span>thed in dresses which dazzled the eyes &#8211; that they were surrounded with armed men who had many Slaves &#8211; and that they made many presents to Indians<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  "Your chiefs continued they are white like the Chiefs of the Spaniards &#8211; but they are not great Chiefs<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They do not look like Chiefs<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Indians think that you impose upon them<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Who made them Chiefs?  are they warriors?  have they taken many scalps?  Why are they superior to other men?  What brought them here?"  It required some consideration to answer<span class="DelHand-author">ed</span> all their questions<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  After some reflection I observed that they were chiefs through the great property they possessed through the great good that property caused among the Indian nations; and that they came here through curiosity and to see the Great men of the Mississouri villages<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
