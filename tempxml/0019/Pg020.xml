These mens names were likewise included in the <span class="DelHand-author">indictment</span> <span class="AddHand-author">charges</span> before <span class="DelHand-author">mentioned</span> <span class="AddHand-author">alluded to</span>, and, were then on their route to Canada to <span class="DelHand-author">submit</span> <span class="AddHand-author">present</span> themselves for trial.

Seeing thus that they would not permit him even to guide his own canoe down, he told Amable Turcotte and Joseph Lepine, two of the men whom he considered most capable, to go up and bring down his canoe.
