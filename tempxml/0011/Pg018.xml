<p style="text-align:justify;">The Chiefs who were more bold began to question me concerning the dignity &amp; influence of these Strangers &amp; what were their motives for coming to the Missurie<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I told the Indians that <span class="DelHand-author">the</span> they came to see them to purchase fine horses, &amp; were curious to Know the country &amp; its situation<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I endeavoured to force from them that respect due to such personages, by launching out in their praise &amp; eminence, but in vain<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Indians saw nothing in their mien or dress that would command respect, &amp; much less by their liberality<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  They were <span class="AddHand-author">accustomed</span> to see white people who brought them their necessaries, but they were accustomed to look upon every white man as an inferior being to themselves<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Therefore those traders whom they had seen formerly (myself included) used to extort respect from them by threats, to which they submited in case of offending the Chief of the whites<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <span class="DelHand-author">Indians</span> <span class="AddHand-author">Gros Ventres</span> had <span class="AddHand-author">heard</span> by tradition of some Indians who had been at the Spanish settlements in former times, <span class="AddHand-author">&amp;</span> who had been admited to the presence of the Governor, he being in a shining dress, surrounded by his domesticks &amp; Guards had made an impression upon their minds accompanied with liberal presents, that those who heard the tradition related formed the same idea of our Chiefs or proprietors in the North<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Indians, indeed, could scarcely believe me that Mess<sup>rs</sup> Chaboillez &amp; Henry were <span class="DelHand-author">the</span> those whom we called our Chiefs &#8211; for said they, were these the Chiefs of whom all the North Indians speak, they would have at least a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pipe</span> of Tobacco to give to an Indian<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Indians began to ask me, who made them Chiefs, were they warriors or what made them superior to other white men?  I told them that they were Chiefs by the multiplicity of their riches, &amp; superior to others, by the many Charities they made to <span class="AddHand-author">the</span> Indians<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  But the more I said in their praise, the more contempt they shewed me &amp; if ever I regrated any <span class="AddHand-author">thing</span> in my life, it was for having said too much, tho, consistent with truth I could not support, from the meanness of their appearance<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
