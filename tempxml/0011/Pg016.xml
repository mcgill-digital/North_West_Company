<p style="text-align:justify;">come &amp; Camp half way to the Missurie, that a free intercourse should be between them &amp; the Missurie Indians for the remainder of the season.  These six days I past <span class="DelHand-author">them</span> with the greatest pleasure that the savage life could afford among variety of new objects &amp; changes<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I here witnessed greater slaughter upon Buffalo than I had been accustom to see at the Missurie<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  I have been with the Shawyens a hunting, or surround the Cattle, with 20 acres of <span class="AddHand-author">their</span> Camp, when they killed (without saying too much) 250 fat Cows which they left on the field as they fell; excepting the Tongues which they dried for a general feast they were to make for the Missurie Indians, whom they expected all in a Band when we should get home<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  At length we took our departure accompanied by some of the Shawyens, who were to invite the Gros Ventres, &amp; the Mandans, &amp; especially the Borgne, for whom they had the Skin of a White Buffalo, which to <span class="DelHand-author">the</span> <span class="AddHand-author">a</span> Gros Ventre is too tempting an article to refuse, for when a man has a white Buffalo hide his fortune is made<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  On the third day we got to the village, where I found M<sup>r</sup> Caldwell very lonesome for my return<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The time being expired in which we were <span class="AddHand-author">to</span> be back, they thought that we were all destroyed<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After many councils held, the Borgne consented to go to the Shawyens with some of his young men &amp; if he found that they were not fond of their horses (to use their on expression) that he would send for the Gros Ventres to trade horses for European Goods<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave a few articles to the Borgne to trade a horse for me, having the loading of the six horses I brought from the Fort already, beside my expectation that the free-man who was trading at the Pawnees <span class="AddHand-editors">[would]</span> come &amp; pay his debts, which if he did I would be obliged to leave behind for want of horses<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Borgne then went to the Shawyens &amp; I began to make preparations</p>
