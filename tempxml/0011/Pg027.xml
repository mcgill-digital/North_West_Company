<p style="text-align:justify;">yet in the possession of chance, &amp; I was of too much utility at that time &amp; place, to M<sup>r</sup> Henry, to keep his anger any lenght<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  A short while after sun set, a horrid uproar arose through out the whole Camp, &amp; every one with utmost speed were runing up a hill where, more than the half of the two nations were already gathered, who by their motion &amp; Cry seemed in an open quarrel<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  As every body went we follow<span class="AddHand-editors">[e]</span>d their example<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  This was occasioned by three Assiniboines who having arrived at the Missurie after our departure had followed our tracks hither<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Assiniboines &amp; the Shawyens not being on peaceable terms, the latter were wishing to put the former to death &#8211; but the Gros Ventres &amp; Mondans, whose protection the Assiniboines relied on &amp; implored, would not allow the Shawyens to destroy them unless they wished to violate the breach of faith between the <span class="AddHand-author">two</span> Nations<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The many threats on both sides nearly brought them to immediate hostility but the G. Vent<sup>rs</sup> &amp; Mandans having fortified the Assiniboines on either side they brought them safe to the centre of the Camp<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Shawyens were enraged to see themselves deprived of their prey by those whom they considered in their heart as their bitter Enemies<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Many were the attempts they made to break through the G. Vent<sup>rs</sup> ranks with naked weapons to kill the Assiniboines who walked in the middle Singing their death S<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ong</span> &#8211; waiting, as it were, with patience their death Blow &#8211; but the Borgne who walked <span class="AddHand-author">r</span>ound &amp; round the poor trembling Assiniboines, brandishing his Battle Ax in the air &amp; threatening immediate revenge on the first who would <span class="AddHand-author">do</span> the least harm to the Assiniboines but at the same time used all his eloquence to peasiphy both nations who were on the eve of engaging in hostility<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The weighty sound of the Borgne's voice was a law to his own nation, &amp; was of terror to the Shawyens (&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Henry himself owned that he had a heroical aspect) which put an end to their mutual contest, for a time in appearance but not in their heart<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
