<p style="text-align:justify;">-tractions that may occur, are too insignificant to need an Explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that so few observations have been made with the Quadrant, was for want of proper places to make them in, 'tis true we have been in Lakes large enough, but the Horizon was generally obscur'd by Islands or clouds at the proper time of day, &amp; I could not make an artificial Horizon for want of Quicksilver.  I am in hopes these obstacles will be removed in lac Ouinipique &amp;c.  Circumstanc'd as we were in an extensive Country, entirely unacquainted without a Guide, the voyage has been compleated very fortunately, &amp; had we not met with a Conductor, when we did, the Voyage must have miscarried, &amp; we probably miscarried also.  The Course who have follow'd, seems not only to be very practicable, but preferable to the C<sup>o</sup> by the Grand Portage.  Tho' we have been a considerable time on the Journey, it is no Objection, as I compute we have lost by bad weather &amp; other Casualties at least 12 or 13 days, &amp; 'tis my sincere Opinion, that a stirring Guide (something like Bazil Irelande) would complete the whole in 3 Weeks.  The Good-fishing-places are numerous, &amp; wild rice may be barter'd from the Indians<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  <span class="DelHand-author">in</span> I know not one Carrying-place all the way that can absolutely be call'd bad, (the worst is the Grand côte de Roche) &amp; the rivers in general are not remarkable for strong Curr<sup>ts</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Portages are all called by the names given them by the Guide, &amp; where he has known none, it is always mention'd by whom the new name was given.  As to any Indian information, I refer you to M<sup>r</sup> S<sup>t</sup> Germaine, who is a much better master of the Ind<sup>n</sup> Language hereabouts.  I indeavour'd to obtain the French names which I thought of more consequence to the Voyageurs.  Any Nets that may be sent this way for the use of the Voyage, should have meshes much smaller than those intended for the G. Portage, we were oblig'd to make one on the voyage, one we rec<sup>d</sup> from M<sup>r</sup> Grant being of no use to us.  The Indians we met on the way were very few compared to the distance, but it was at a time of year when the major part were hunting, those we did meet we found very well disposed &amp; they left us on terms of Friendship, but we found it very necessary to inform them with the intentions of our voyage without any disguise,</p>
