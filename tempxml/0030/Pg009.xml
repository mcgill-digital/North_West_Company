<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="fw">1784</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Lake opens wide, a remarkable round island of high land appearing in the front of the Strait &#8211; then ro<sup>d</sup> the point to the S<sup>o</sup> point of an island NW1½m. hav<sup>g</sup> many islands on our right &#8211; NNW1m. to a point on the main &#8211; then N<sup>o</sup> 2m. across a Bay, passing very near an island on our Right &#8211; then ro<sup>d</sup> the point, &amp; along a steep rocky Shore NW4m. to the W<sup>t</sup> end of an isl<sup>d</sup> very high &amp; shaped like a Barn.  Here we met with a Tent of Ind<sup>s</sup> one of whom we intended to engage as a Pilot, but they were unacquainted with the road.  We made them a small present of Tobacco powder &amp; Shot &amp; departed.  Opposite to this point NWbN3m. <span class="AddHand-author">at the bottom of a Bay</span> lays the beginning of the River we have to enter: 3 pointed mountains lay on the left near its entrance.  1<sup>st</sup> Course in the River NbW½m. S.C. &amp; ab<sup>t</sup> 60yds wide, then NW¼m. to the Portage le petit Jour, 280yds over &amp; good road, at the bottom of this rapid plenty of fish may be taken &#8211; then NWbN<sup><span class="DelHand-author">2</span></sup><span class="AddHand-author">½</span>m. strong Curr<sup>t</sup> small rapid &amp; stones above water &amp; shoaly in places, the men debark'd &amp; led y<sup>e</sup> Canoe up the middle of it, at the end of this C<sup>o</sup> the river opens wide forming a small Lake then NW1m. to a point.  The Ind<sup>s</sup> we left follow'd us with their families &amp; Baggage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">June 26 <span class="DelHand-author">Sunday</span> Saturday.  The Ind<sup>s</sup> here offer'd a few Skins to Trade, &amp; they would have been displeas'd had we denied it.  These with a few got from the Guide amounts to 8 Otters, 1 Peccant, 2 Beaver, 2 cub Beaver, 3 martins &amp; 2 mink.  Nothing was done this day, but making a net with smaller meshes.  The distress we are in for a Guide is very great.  This fellow possesses all the duplicity of the devil himself.  One day he knows our way better than any Indian in the Country, the next day he knows nothing ab<sup>t</sup> it, at one time he is ready to do us any Service, &amp; soon after will Threaten our lives but our Situation is such, we must accept of him or give up the Journey<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 Sunday.  The Guide said this morn<sup>g</sup> he would go with us no farther, so that we <span class="DelHand-author">we</span> resolv'd to wait here 'till the French people pass by, especially as the men have no <span class="DelHand-author">a</span><span class="AddHand-author">O</span>ccassion to eat much of their Corn, fish being tolerably plenty.  Finding we were likely to remain here this day<span class="AddHand-editors">[,]</span> I went in an Indian canoe across the lake to the River we have to enter.  I went as far as the 2<sup>d</sup> Carrying place &amp; then return'd, but was much concern'd to find the Ind<sup>s</sup> all drunk, notwithstanding it had been my <span class="DelHand-author">ust</span> utmost care to keep them sober, especially while our villain of a Guide is with them.  It seems they came &amp; took the liquor forcibly, tho' they were but 3 of them &amp; 6 of our People.  S<sup>t</sup> Germaine says none of the men would help him except Jean Roy, they afterw<sup>ds</sup> recover'd the liquor, but not 'till the Ind<sup>s</sup> had taken out enough to make them all drunk men &amp; women.  I expected much Trouble in consequence of the above, &amp; accordingly we had our hands full.  Our old troublesome fellow was so outrageous, we could hardly keep him from breaking the Canoe, &amp; doing every mischief.  He was particularly violent ag<sup>t</sup> me, for detecting him in his last villiany.  The other Ind<sup>s</sup> were very peaceable &amp; help'd us to cool this Firebrand, in short we <span class="AddHand-author">know</span> not what to do with him, he follows us every where, destroys our provisions &amp; keeps us under continual apprehensions.</p>
