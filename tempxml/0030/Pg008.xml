<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AddHand-editors">[I]</span>n the middle of this Course we were oblig'd to put back &amp; encamp on Account of wind, &amp; here our Guide gave a fresh determination that he would proceed no farther<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  Yesterday he came into our Tent &amp; gave us an Acc<sup>t</sup> of the Carry<sup>g</sup> places to Portage de l'Isle, which he made am<sup>t</sup> to 66 besides 6 Lakes, for which favour he requested a drink, a little of which was given him: but my Gentleman afterw<sup>ds</sup> grew so violently outrageous as to threaten destruction to every thing ab<sup>t</sup> him, by turns flattering, threatning, &amp; then endeavouring to Theive &amp; break the Canoes.  Tho' the fairest promises &amp; kindnest usage has been given this man, it is all to no purpose, for at the very inst<sup>t</sup> I was writing the above one of our men has brought an Acc<sup>t</sup> of his having found a 9 Gall. keg ½ full of mix'd liquor in y<sup>e</sup> woods, which he found means to Steal, tho' a sharp look out is kept, I entic'd the father &amp; Son to the place, by telling them I had found y<sup>e</sup> fresh track of <span class="AddHand-author">a</span> Moose, they came very unsuspectingly to the place, but how great was his Surprize when I shew'd him the keg of liquor: after upbraiding him with his Perfidy, I oblig'd the father to carry it back to our Baggage, &amp; <span class="AddHand-author">as</span> to <span class="AddHand-author">the</span> Son he took to the woods &amp; was <span class="DelHand-author">of no of</span> hear'd of no more for sev<sup>l</sup> hours.  We were soon afterw<sup>ds</sup> outwardly Good friends, but experience says no confidence can be put in this Villain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">June 24 Thursday.  The continuance of the wind prevented us from proceeding this day before it was late in the afternoon, when we set off, our Ind<sup>n</sup> Guide in C<sup>o</sup> finish'd the last Course ment<sup>d</sup> yesterday, at the end of which pass'd the point leaving a small isl<sup>d</sup> on our Right.  After turning the point, we went WbN3m. to a place, where a Settlem<sup>t</sup> has formerly been erected, but no Traces are now to be seen of it except the wood being cut away, here the dilatory proceedings of the Guide oblig'd us to encamp.  Lat.obs<sup>d</sup> 49°42'<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  The Knavery of the Ind<sup>n</sup> together with the continual deceit he has practic'd on us, determin'd us to go on with<sup>t</sup> him, especially as the N° of his family lays very heavy on our provisions: finding us thus resolv<sup>d</sup>, he pray'd to be employ'd, but we told him this could not be done, unless he would promise most faithfully to be good &amp; honest; on this condition we promis'd him ev'ry kindness &amp; good paym<sup>t</sup> &amp; on the contrary told him he must leave us without paym<sup>t</sup> in goods, but a severe paym<sup>t</sup> in Stripes &#8211; he promis'd ev'ry thing we could desire &#8211; how long he may keep his word time must determine, but nothing but absolute necessity could induce a Person to have any thing to do with a man possess'd of every bad Quality, &amp; whose mind is as black as his outward Skin.</p>

From the old French House N<sup>o</sup> to a point on the main shore 4m. pass'd 2 isl<sup>ds</sup> on our right, &amp; a small River on the left &#8211; from hence across a Bay to a lofty Peek of perpendicular rocks NbE7m. sev<sup>l</sup> isl<sup>ds</sup> in the Bay on our left, &amp; high mountaneous land, from the Peek 3½m.
