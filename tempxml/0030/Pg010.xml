</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">June 28 Monday.  The last night we were oblig'd to keep 2 men continually up to Guard our Things, the Villian being always ready to break y<sup>e</sup> Canoe.  This morning I consulted with M<sup>r</sup> S<sup>t</sup> Germaine on our Situation, being entirely without a Guide &amp; no prospect of procuring one.  I must confess I never was more uneasy, well knowing it is impossible to make our Journey, while this fellow is in our C<sup>o</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  One of the Indians here has offer'd to conduct us to a place call'd Tête de Bête Puante, which is in our road, but this man has 8 Persons in family, &amp; we must maintain them, or be retarded on the Journey while he goes a hunting, consequently our Provisions will be in no condition to continue the Journey farther, &amp; farther he does not know the way &#8211; &amp; even when we are there, the obtaining a Guide to Port de l'Isle is very precarious &#8211; reflecting on these matters, we resolv'd to return to the other end of Port. de Petit jour &amp; there wait the return of the French People, fish not being in Suff<sup>t</sup> plenty where we are to save the corn.  But thank God, our gloomy apprehensions were in a great measure obliterated in the afternoon by the arrival of a Canoe, with a Frenchman &amp; Ind<sup>n</sup> in it.  The former is call'd Constant, &amp; is a Guide in the service of Mons<sup>r</sup> Cotè, 60 packs has been made this winter in his Quarter, but 4 of their men have been Eat by the Savages tho' extremity of hunger.  Constant says a Canadian is near hand, who is not at present engag'd to any one, is well acquainted with the Road, &amp; <span class="DelHand-author">not at pres</span> he thinks will be willing to engage with us.  This is a prize not to be lost, &amp; that <span class="AddHand-author">we</span> may see him as soon as possible, mean to send after him to-morrow.  This man says we may reach Lac Rouge in 15 days from hence, but adds <span class="DelHand-author">the Ins<sup>d</sup></span> the Ind<sup>s</sup> on the road are not very friendly.  Made Roy a present for aiding S<sup>t</sup> Germ<sup>e</sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 Tuesday.  M<sup>r</sup> S<sup>t</sup> Germaine set off this morning, with the man that arrived yesterday, in quest of the man we are in hopes to engage.  I staid with the men to guard our Things.  They return'd in the Evening.  He is nam'd Pierre Bonneau.  <span class="AddHand-editors">[H]</span>e knows the way as far as Sturgeon lake, w<sup>ch</sup> he says is above half the way, &amp; the greatest part of the Portages over.  To-mor<sup>w</sup> he means to give us his determination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30 Wednesday.  This day &amp; last night proved remarkable Tempestuous.  We made our agreem<sup>t</sup> with Bonneau to guide us to Sturgeon lake, &amp; farther he is not content to go; we wish'd much to engage him to winter but found it impossible.  The Goods he is to receive for his Trouble is specified in his Agreem<sup>t</sup> of w<sup>ch</sup> he has a Copy.  What other things he may occasionally receive, I shall notice, &amp; God willing leave this place To-morrow early.  This the 12<sup>th</sup> day since we left the last Port. the other side of lac Nippigon, &amp; this is absolutely not 2 days paddling.  Lat. by 2 Alt<sup>s</sup> 50°02'.  One Canoe of Nippigon Ind<sup>s</sup> &amp; 2 Canoes in the Service of M<sup>r</sup> Coté came to us to day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">July 1<sup>st</sup> Thursday.  Made y<sup>e</sup> Indians a pres<sup>t</sup> of Tobacco Powder &amp; Shot &amp; departed<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
