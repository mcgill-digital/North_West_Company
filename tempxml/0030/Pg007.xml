<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="fw">1784.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">paym<sup>t</sup> here, &amp; were desirous to leave us, but I was resolv'd to deny this to the last 'till their agreem<sup>t</sup> was compleated; they tried sev<sup>l</sup> Indian fetches to raize a drink, but as they found we we determin'd to keep our word, they consented to accompany us.  We made some small presents to a few left behind &amp; proceeded on a Course NWbN. between 2 islands which appear from y<sup>e</sup> end of the Portage 14m. to a point.  Before this C<sup>o</sup> was compleated we met a family of Ind<sup><span class="AddHand-editors">[s]</span></sup> in 2 Canoes: the man remember'd Seeing me at Severn Fort on the Coast of Hudson's Bay, he belongs to Sturgeon Lake, &amp; has agreed to Pilot us to Portage de l'Isle, proceeded with him a few miles when we we Stop'd by Thunder, Wind &amp; Rain.  He pretends he has a Son hereabouts whom he must see before he can go with us, he proposes to set off To-morrow morning &amp; return ab<sup>t</sup> 2 o'clock.  We parted C<sup>o</sup> with our first Guides entirely satisfied with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">June 21 Monday.  Sev<sup>l</sup> Ind<sup>s</sup> came to us yesterday afternoon, which proved very rainy &amp; Stormy, with thunder &amp; lightening.  The Ind<sup>s</sup> were very troublesome for a drink, a little of which was given them.  Our guide told us flatly this morn<sup>g</sup> he would not go with us, but on our setting off with another he soon follow'd us.  Proceeded from the point ment<sup>d</sup> yesterday across a Bay NNW3m. then NWbN to a p<sup>t</sup> across another Bay 4m. but instead of crossing it entirely we turn'd round a point in the middle of it, this leads into an opening like a river &#8211; 1<sup>st</sup> C<sup>o</sup> in it is WSW1½m. then WbN1m. WNW1m. which opens into y<sup>e</sup> Lake, then W<sup>t</sup> 3m. to y<sup>e</sup> N<sup>o</sup> end of the 1<sup>st</sup> isl<sup>d</sup> which appears from the S<sup>o</sup> shore &#8211; then WbN6m. between sev<sup>l</sup> islands to a rocky point &#8211; here we slept<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span>  It is necessary to remark, that a young Guide ought to be provided with a compass in this Lake, as it is full of isl<sup>ds</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> form as many openings<span class="AddHand-editors">[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 Tuesday.  This day it blew so hard W<sup>tly</sup> that we could not proceed.  The men were employ'd putting the Canoe in better trim for the Carrying places: the ribs &amp; Timbers were all taken out, washed &amp; made smaller, so that now she is considerably lighter.  The guide is very wavering in his opinion, he this day told us he must be oblig'd to leave us on Acc<sup>t</sup> of his wife's sickness, tho' she was equally bad when he first <span class="DelHand-author">engg</span> engag'd.  Every reasonable promise is made him to persuade him to continue the Journey; but Ind<sup>s</sup> will be Ind<sup>s</sup> to the last of the Chapter.  We tried to fish in the Lac, but the mesh<span class="AddHand-editors">[ing]</span> of the nets are too large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 Wednesday.  From the rocky point ment<sup>d</sup> <span class="DelHand-author">yesterday</span> the day before yesterday, we proceeded WNW. to the S<sup>o</sup> end of an isl<sup>d</sup> 2½m. at the end of which lays a small rocky island a short distance off, went between them then NW1m. to y<sup>e</sup> point of an isl<sup>d</sup> &#8211; then NWbW3m. to the p<sup>t</sup> of another isl<sup>d</sup> of high land, coast along the end of this isl<sup>d</sup> 1½m. NW &#8211; then to a point across a Bay NWbN<span class="AddHand-editors">[6m.]</span></p>
